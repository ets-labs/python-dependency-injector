Introduction
------------

Python ecosystem consists of a big amount of various classes, functions and
objects that could be used for applications development. Each of them has its
own role.

Modern Python applications are mostly the composition of well-known open
source systems, frameworks, libraries and some turnkey functionality.

When application goes bigger, its amount of objects and their dependencies
also increased extremely fast and became hard to maintain.

**Objects** is designed to be developer's friendly tool for managing objects
and their dependencies in formal, pretty way. Main idea of **Objects** is to
keep dependencies under control.

Installation
------------

**Objects** library is available on PyPi_::

    pip install objects
