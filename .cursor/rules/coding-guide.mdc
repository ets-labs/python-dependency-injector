- Follow PEP 8 rules
- When you write imports, split system, 3rd-party, and local imports with a new line
- Have two empty lines between the import block and the rest of the code
- Have an empty line (\n) at the end of every file
- If a file is supposed to be run, always add ``if __name__ == 'main'``
- Always follow a consistent pattern of using double or single quotes
- When there is a class without a docblock, leave one blank line before its members, e.g.:
```python
class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):

    service = providers.Factory(Service)
```

- Avoid shortcuts in names unless absolutely necessary, exceptions:
```
arg
args
kwarg
kwargs
obj
cls
```

- Avoid inline comments unless absolutely necessary
