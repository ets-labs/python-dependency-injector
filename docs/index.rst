   :description: Dependency Injector is a dependency injection microframework 
                 for Python. It was designed to be unified, developer-friendly 
                 tool that helps to implement dependency injection design 
                 pattern in formal, pretty, Pythonic way. Dependency Injector 
                 provides implementations of such popular design patterns 
                 like IoC container, Factory and Singleton. Dependency 
                 Injector providers are implemented as C extension types 
                 using Cython.

What is ``Dependency Injector``?
================================

``Dependency Injector`` is a dependency injection microframework for Python.
It was designed to be a unified and developer-friendly tool that helps
implement a dependency injection design pattern in a formal, pretty, and
Pythonic way.

The key features of the *Dependency Injector* framework are:

+ Easy, smart, and pythonic style.
+ Obvious and clear structure.
+ Extensibility and flexibility.
+ High performance.
+ Memory efficiency.
+ Thread safety.
+ Documented.
+ Semantically versioned.

*Dependency Injector* containers and providers are implemented as C extension
types using Cython.
